=============

My **very personal** 2 cents about what is needed for doing OpenSource today. I think it should easily apply to your personal little pet or to big corporations. **Opinions here are absolutely my own.** 

If you agree with me, star this, if you don't, submit a PR. Thanks.

# What to Opensource?
Everything.

# What to do before opening a repo?

Nothing. First you create an empty repo and then you put stuff in there. Open Sourcing "later" (almost) never works.

# Is &*!@£% good enough to be opened?

* If your stuff is unuseful, people won't use it. So, why not anyway? **We learn from mistakes.**
* If your stuff doesn't work, people won't use it. So, why not anyway? **We learn from mistakes.**

# Is !£@$^%£ safe to be opened?

* Look at yourself in the mirror. We are awesome on making mistakes. There are tools for preventing us to make them. Use them. If a tool doesn't exist, create it yourself and then opensource it.

# External contributors need to sign the papers

* No! If you want to contribute, you need to submit a PR with good code. Stop. 
* External contributor gets a PR merged? Make it admin. If he does something wrong, you will notice it and you will remove that person later.

# How can I be sure that I can trust people?
* Hire good people.
* Socialise with good people.
* Create a code of conduct or a contributing guideline.

# Let's discuss this privately

No. Open everything. Discussions, Test results, Issues, everything.
